pam_subuid
==========

A PAM module that automatically populates `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` entries.

Subordinate user and group ID entries are required in order to use container
engines such as [Podman](https://podman.io/) in "rootless" mode.

Although recent versions of `useradd(8)` do populate `/etc/subuid` and
`/etc/subgid` when a user is added, systems that use an external identity
management system such as [FreeIPA](https://www.freeipa.org/) won't have any
entries in those files. This module was written to avoid having to maintain
such entires manually.

Building
--------

You will need [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) installed.

```
$ meson setup . build --prefix=/

$ meson compile -C build

$ meson test -C build 
```

Installing
----------

```
$ meson install -C build
```

How you configure the module within your PAM stack depends. For example, on a
Debian system you can place the following at the end of
`/etc/pam.d/common-session`:

```
session optional pam_subuid.so
```

Then log in and check for newly created entries in `/etc/subuid` and
`/etc/subgid`.

Remarks
-------

⚠️ This module is a proof-of-concept. It is not battle-hardened. Don't install
it on your important production cluster. But please try it out and send
feedback (or pull requests!)

⚠️ I'm not an expert C programmer! I've used GNU extensions and probably
committed other sins that may turn the stomach of seasoned systems programmers.

subuid entries will be allocated from the range defined in `login.defs(5)` by
`SUB_UID_MIN` and `SUB_UID_MAX`. The number of entries is determined by
`SUB_UID_COUNT`.

`SUB_GID_MIN`, `SUB_GID_MAX` and `SUB_GID_COUNT` determine how subgid entires
are allocated.

If a user has an existing subuid or subgid allocation then they won't receive a
new one, even if the existing one is too small per `SUB_UID_COUNT` and
`SUB_GID_COUNT`.

Locking is performed to try to prevent two users logging in at the same time
from receiving the same allocation.

The module depends on the `usermod(8)` command to actaully modify the
subuid/subgid files.
